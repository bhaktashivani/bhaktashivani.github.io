        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Shivani 
        </p>
        <img src = 'shivani_photo.jpg' width = '400' height = auto> 
        <p> 
          I am a recent graduate from University of California, San Diego with Masterâ€™s in the Intelligent Systems, Robotics & Control (ISRC) from the 
          Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering with a 
          focus on Machine Learning & Controls at the University of California, San Diego.  
        </p>
        <p>   
          My areas of interest span across different fields including machine learning and artificial intelligence, data science, product management, 
          and business development. 
          I am passionate about exploring AI's latest advancements and potential applications, 
          as well as using my creativity to design and manage innovative products. 
          I am also developing my skills in business development to identify and pursue strategic opportunities for growth and 
          success.
        </p>
        <p>  
          As a curious and hardworking engineer and entrepreneur, I am always eager to learn something new in the business and technology world. 
          I am committed to making a meaningful impact on society through the power of technology. I am also developing my skills in Data Analytics
          to drive innovation and growth in the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I believe with the exponential growth of data 
          and the increasing demand for data-driven solutions, proficiency in data analytics empowers individuals to leverage the power of information, 
          uncover patterns, and create intelligent systems that have the potential to revolutionize industries and enhance user experiences.
